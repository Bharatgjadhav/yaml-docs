kubeadm upgrade plan


Upgrading
-----------
There are daemonsets created in this cluster, especially in the kube-system namespace. To ignore these objects and drain the node, we can make use of the --ignore-daemonsets flag.


kubectl drain controlplane --ignore-daemonsets




On the controlplane node, run the command run the following commands:

apt update
This will update the package lists from the software repository.

apt install kubeadm=1.20.0-00
This will install the kubeadm version 1.20

kubeadm upgrade apply v1.20.0
This will upgrade kubernetes controlplane. Note that this can take a few minutes.

apt install kubelet=1.20.0-00 This will update the kubelet with the version 1.20.

You may need to restart kubelet after it has been upgraded.
Run: systemctl restart kubelet


kubectl uncordon controlplane 



upgrading worker nodes
--------------------
kubectl drain node01 --ignore-daemonsets



On the node01 node, run the command run the following commands:

If you are on the master node, run ssh node01 to go to node01


apt update
This will update the package lists from the software repository.


apt install kubeadm=1.20.0-00
This will install the kubeadm version 1.20


kubeadm upgrade node
This will upgrade the node01 configuration.


apt install kubelet=1.20.0-00 This will update the kubelet with the version 1.20.


You may need to restart kubelet after it has been upgraded.
Run: systemctl restart kubelet


Type exit or enter CTL + d to go back to the controlplane node.
